| Ontario           | 3063212.47638369          |

|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Nunavut                 | 116376.48383522           |
| Northwest Territories   | 800847.330903053          |
| Yukon                   | 975867.375723362          |
```
The sales analysis by region highlights significant disparities in revenue generation across different geographical areas. The "West," "Ontario," and "Prarie" regions are clearly the top performers, contributing the most to overall sales. This suggests strong market presence and customer base in these areas.

Conversely, "Nunavut," "Northwest Territories," and "Yukon" represent the bottom three regions in terms of sales. Their significantly lower sales figures indicate either a weaker market penetration, lower population density, or specific logistical/economic challenges.
